### Data App: Query database, Analyse data & Share results through API


#### Description
The scope of this project is to query sample weather data stored in a database, perform a basic climate analysis and make results available delivering a JSON response through a Web API (Application Programming Interface).

#### Script Summary
This script takes advantage of Python & SQLAlchemy ORM (Object Relational Mapper) to query data from a SQLite database. The analysis was performed in Jupyter Notebook using Pandas and Matplotlib for data visualization. Flask framework was used to build the web API.
